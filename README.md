# MyTaskManager
Just a little task manager of mine.
I've created this as my university project in 2nd semester. Just wanted to figure out how to operate with Android systems.
It's nothing too special, but it gave me some basic knowledge about how do real applications work and what difficulties a developer
can encount.
